# Hyperlocal Community Food Surplus Exchange Platform 🍱🌍

A MERN stack–based web application designed to reduce food wastage by connecting surplus food donors with nearby receivers in a hyperlocal community. The platform enables real-time food listings, location-based discovery, and sustainable handling of organic waste through composting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Food wastage and hunger often coexist due to the absence of a simple, real-time, and location-based food sharing system. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a community-driven platform where individuals, restaurants, mess services, and event organizers can donate surplus food, while NGOs, volunteers, and individuals in need can discover and collect it before it goes to waste.

The system also supports tagging of non-edible food waste for composting, promoting sustainability and a circular food economy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce edible food wastage through hyperlocal redistribution  
- Connect food donors and receivers using location-based technology  
- Support NGOs and volunteers with real-time food availability  
- Enable sustainable handling of organic waste via composting  
- Build a trust-driven community using verification and feedback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hyperlocal-food-surplus-platform.git
   cd hyperlocal-food-surplus-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_key
   CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_secret
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### API Endpoints

The API will be available at the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api`). Check the routes directory for available endpoints.
